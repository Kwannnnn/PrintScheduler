### Description

This is DHI2V.So Team 2's proof-of-concept mock-up Java application for the course System Design.
Its purpose is to illustrate the workings of the proposed architecture by simulating the design. The simulation defines classes as various components, namely the microservices and data transmitted between these microservices.
### Instruction manual

Running the application can simply be done by executing the ***main*** method inside the ***Main*** class, after which the
simulation output will be printed on the console.

Different requests can be sent by modifying the ***message*** parameter when initializing a new **Request**.
